# Palenzo.github.io

This repository is a GitHub Pages user site. The `index.html` at the repository root is served at `https://Palenzo.github.io` once changes are pushed to the default branch and Pages is enabled.

How to publish (PowerShell):

```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "Create GitHub Pages profile site"
git push origin main
```

If GitHub Pages is not already enabled for the repository, go to the repository Settings → Pages and set the source to the `main` branch and folder `/ (root)`.

Notes and assumptions:

- I assumed your GitHub username is `Palenzo` based on the repository name. If your username is different (for example `palnezo`), let me know and I will update text and links.
- Update `index.html` with your real bio, project links, avatar, and email before pushing.
